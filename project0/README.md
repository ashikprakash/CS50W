## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

So far in this Programming project I created a mockup personal site that included a landscape index page with four hyperlinks that allows users to connect to me via social links.

As this project was just to get you a feel of `HTML` and `CSS` I didn't really see the need to create anymore than a landscape page. We're suppose to implement four different `.html` that makes use of Bootstrap components and grid layouts. Adding an `about.html` page which will be used for later purposes like `projects.html` and another `.html` file. But, in the meantime I learned a few things and had to do more `DOM` manipulation than I thought.

### TODO

- [ ] Add SASS File
- [ ] Use four HTML pages
- [x] Use Bootstrap 4
- [x] Make use of Images
- [x] Make use of Hyperlinks
